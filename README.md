# AlkoTracker  
AlkoTracker works like a compass, but the destination is the nearest Alko from your location. The app will warn you if you're going to the wrong direction by changing the color of the screen and vibrating.  

### Instructions  
1. Clone the project
2. Install CocoaPods
3. Create a property list called Keys.plist into /AlkoTracker/AlkoTracker with a pair `API_KEY: your google api key`
   * You can get the api key from [google developer console](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/get-api-key)
4. Run `pod install` in the root of the project
5. Run project from the created workspace
